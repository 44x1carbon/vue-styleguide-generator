## Vue js compoentns style guide generator

Initially started after reading [this feature request](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-requests/issues/17).
Now only basic proof of concept is availbale which can load .vue file, parse it and extract basic props of it.
Target is to have some tool with at least som of the [React version](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist) capabilities.

### How to try

 - Clone ot download this repo
 - ```npm install```
 - ```node index.js``` 
 - you'll see simple console output of the 'VueSound.vue' file
